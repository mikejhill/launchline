# LaunchLine

> **Note:** This project was built entirely with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) as a demonstration of AI-assisted software development.

[![Publish](https://github.com/mikejhill/LaunchLine/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mikejhill/LaunchLine/actions/workflows/publish.yml)

A lightweight terminal launcher for interactive CLI tools. Define your frequently
used commands in a TOML config file, then pick them from a fuzzy-searchable menu
instead of remembering flags and paths.

## Why

Switching between CLI tools — AI assistants, shells, dev utilities — means
remembering commands, flags, working directories, and environment variables.
LaunchLine puts them all in one menu so you press a number or type a few letters
instead.

## Features

- **Fuzzy search** — type any substring to narrow the list instantly
- **Numbered shortcuts** — press a digit to launch directly
- **Per-entry environment and working directory** — set once, forget forever
- **Auto-restart or exit** — configurable behavior after a tool exits
- **Zero runtime dependencies** — pure Python 3.12+, nothing to install beyond itself
- **Auto-generated starter config** — creates `~/.config/launchline/config.toml`
  on first run if no config exists

## Installation

### With uv (recommended)

```sh
uv tool install launchline
```

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mikejhill/LaunchLine.git
cd LaunchLine
uv sync --group dev
uv run launchline
```

## Quick Start

1. Run `launchline`. If no config exists, a starter config is created at
   `~/.config/launchline/config.toml`.
2. Edit the config to add your tools.
3. Run `launchline` again.

Override the config path:

```sh
# CLI flag (highest priority)
launchline --config ~/my-config.toml

# Environment variable
export LAUNCHLINE_CONFIG=~/my-config.toml
launchline
```

Resolution order: `--config` flag > `LAUNCHLINE_CONFIG` env var > default path.

## Configuration Reference

Config file format is [TOML](https://toml.io). The file has an optional
`[settings]` table and one or more `[[entries]]` tables.

### `[settings]`

| Key              | Type   | Default       | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `on_exit`        | string | `"restart"`   | Behavior after a launched tool exits: `restart` or `exit` |
| `title`          | string | `"LaunchLine"`| Window/tab title shown while the launcher is active |
| `clear_on_launch`| bool   | `true`        | Clear terminal before launching an entry            |
| `show_exit`      | bool   | `true`        | Show the **Exit** entry (shortcut `0`) in the menu  |

### `[[entries]]`

Each `[[entries]]` table defines one launchable tool:

| Key                | Type            | Required | Default | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | string          | yes      | —       | Display name shown in the menu                 |
| `command`          | string          | yes      | —       | Executable to run                              |
| `args`             | list of strings | no       | `[]`    | Arguments passed to the command                |
| `description`      | string          | no       | `""`    | Short description shown next to the name       |
| `working_directory`| string          | no       | —       | Working directory for the subprocess           |
| `env`              | table           | no       | `{}`    | Extra environment variables (`KEY = "value"`)  |

### Validation Rules

- At least one `[[entries]]` table is required.
- Every entry must have both `name` and `command`.
- `on_exit` must be `"restart"` or `"exit"`.
- `args` must be a list (not a bare string).
- `env` must be a TOML table (not a string or list).
- If `working_directory` does not exist at load time, it is silently reset to
  `None` (a warning is logged).

### Example Config

```toml
[settings]
on_exit = "restart"
title = "My Tools"
clear_on_launch = true
show_exit = true

[[entries]]
name = "GitHub Copilot CLI"
command = "copilot"

[[entries]]
name = "Claude Code"
command = "claude"
description = "Anthropic coding agent"
working_directory = "~/projects"

[[entries]]
name = "PowerShell"
command = "pwsh"
args = ["-NoProfile"]
env = { TERM = "xterm-256color" }
```

## Usage

| Key                | Action                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `1`–`9`           | Launch entry by number                   |
| `0`               | Exit (when `show_exit` is enabled)       |
| Type any text      | Fuzzy-filter the entry list              |
| `Up` / `Down`      | Move highlight                           |
| `Enter`            | Launch highlighted entry                 |
| `Escape`           | Clear filter (or exit if filter is empty) |
| `Backspace`        | Delete last character from filter        |
| `Ctrl+U`           | Clear filter                             |

## Windows Terminal Integration

Add LaunchLine as a Windows Terminal profile to use it as your default launcher:

```jsonc
// In your Windows Terminal settings.json → profiles.list
{
    "name": "LaunchLine",
    "commandline": "launchline",
    "startingDirectory": "%USERPROFILE%",
    "icon": "ms-appx:///ProfileIcons/{9acb9455-ca41-5af7-950f-6bca1bc9722f}.png"
}
```

Set it as the default profile to see the launcher every time you open a terminal.

## Development
